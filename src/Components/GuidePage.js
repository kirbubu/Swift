                                Many people face a problem whenever they see a word that they do 
                                not recognize. We live in an age where the Internet is used heavily.
                                An increasing amount of people are using the Internet to learn new 
                                information. With many pages being visited every day by a single 
                                person, they are bound to encounter words that they do not recognize. 
                                The information age we live in relies a lot on the Internet. 
                                When people find a word they do not know the meaning of, a phrase,
                                or name that they do not recognize, they have to open another tab 
                                in order to search for the meaning of what they are interested in.
                                The rate at which we transfer requests from our brains to computers
                                needs to be sped up and this project will help us move one step
                                further towards this goal.  
                                </p>

                                The goal of Swiftionary is to help people find the meaning of words
                                faster without having to open another tab. It is for people who want
                                to learn new information at a faster rate.  Swiftionary has many features 
                                for its users. They can find the definition of a word. They may want to go
                                more in depth, and find the antonym/synonym. If a name is highlighted,
                                the three most popular results with that name will be presented to
                                the user. If a phrase is highlighted, the user will be presented with
                                the meaning of that phrase. If a foreign word or phrase is highlighted,
                                it will be translated to English. If an incorrect word or phrase is
                                highlighted, it will be spell checked to find how to spell it correctly. 
                                </p>

                                <hr/>
                                <p>
                                To get started, the user will need to find Swiftionary on the Google Chrome
                                web store. They can use the search bar on the Google Chrome web store and
                                type in “Swiftionary” to find the page for the extension. Once they find
                                the web extension, they must click install so they can install the 
                                extension for their browser. When the extension is installed, the user 
                                can click on the Swiftionary logo on the taskbar and go to the preferences 
                                menu. They can choose which features they would like to remove so the 
                                features that are not relevant to them will not appear. This will make it 
                                easier for them to not feel overwhelmed when they right click on a word or 
                                phrase since they won’t be seeing every single option that may not be 
                                relevant to them. After they are finished with their preferences, they can 
                                now see the options provided from Swiftionary when they highlight a word 
                                or phrase and right click on it.
                                </p>

                                The way to use this project will be through the use of 
                                highlighting and right clicking. First, the user needs to 
                                use their mouse to highlight the word or phrase that they 
                                are interested in. The user must now right click on 
                                the word or phrase for the relevant options from the extension 
                                to appear. Once an option is clicked on from the list, a box will 
                                appear that shows the relevant information needed to answer the users 
                                request. This information will be presented to the user all within the 
                                same tab that they are currently viewing; they do not need to deviate from 
                                the page that they are viewing. A new tab will not need to be opened in 
                                order for them to attain the relevant information that they desire. 
                                This is a core concept of the project. The project will be built with 
                                efficiency in mind. The project needs to be as efficient as possible since 
                                accuracy and speed are ways to measure the usefulness of the project.

                                Billy decides to do some personal research on frogs and comes across 
                                a word that he does not understand. Frustrated with having to 
                                constantly open separate tabs when he wants to learn something about 
                                a word, so he decides to look for an extension to help with this 
                                issue. 
                                </p>

                                After a while Billy comes across the the extension Swiftionary and decides to try it out. 
                                He makes sure to look at the on site tutorials and examples to make sure it is the kind of 
                                extension he wants.  After he is sure he downloads it and he heads back to the website to 
                                give it a test run.    
                                </p>
                                <img src="userg3.png" className="ImageAlign"/>
                                <p>
                                Billy highlights the word that he was originally unsure about with his hopes held high. 
                                Next he right clicks the highlighted word to bring up the right click menu.
                                </p>
                                <img src="userg4.png" className="ImageAlign"/>
                                <p>
                                Billy now sees that he has a new option to pick from on his right click menu. He moves his cursor over the new 
                                Swiftionary option and a new menu will appear to the right of that with the settings that 
                                Billy has set into his Swiftionary preferences.
                                </p>
                                <img src="userg5.png" className="ImageAlign"/>
                                <p>
                                Billy could have chosen to see less options for a single word highlight but has chosen to 
                                see how many options he has to work with. From the option menu that has appeared Billy can 
                                select from a total of six different functions. To find out more on what the word means Billy 
                                decides to select the definition option.
                                </p>
                                <img src="userg6.png" className="ImageAlign"/>
                                <p>
                                A small window opens onto the window and tab that Billy was currently in and gives him the 
                                definition of the word that he wanted to know. The window was small and the result fast so 
                                Billy could continue with his research on frogs without any additional hassle. Happy at this 
                                Billy told all his frogs of his new discovery.

                                when right clicking, and uncheck the desired option to not see the option.
