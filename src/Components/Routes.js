/**
 * Routes Component 
 * 
 * Routes is a BrowserRouter Component that contains all of the available routes
 * to the different webpages. It renders new components on the screen instead of
 * loading up completely different html files, which is a hassle to code.
 * 
 * The BrowserRouter class encapsulates different routes, whose paths determine
 * what the url extension to the original webpage needs to be. 
 * 
 * For example, localhost:3000 would load the MainPage component, while
 * localhost:3000/downloads would load the DownloadPage component.
 * 
 * Instantiating this module in a different app will render the components whenever
 * the url is defined. <Routes/> is called in App.cs before MainNav.
